# üêç Foundations of Data Science Lab Codes

1. Introduction and installation of Python and Python IDEs for data science (SpyderAnaconda, Jupyter Notebook etc.)
2. Design a Python program to generate and print a list except for the first 5 elements,
   where the values are squares of numbers between 1 and 30.
3. Design a python program to understand the working of loops
    - Reverse a given string using both for and while loops
    - WAP to find sum of digits of a given number
    - WAP to find factorial of a number.
    - WAP to generate Fibonacci series.
    - WAP to print the following pattern (equilateral triangle)
    ```
        *
       ***
      *****
     *******
    *********
    ```
4. Design a Python function to find the max of three
   numbers.
5. Design a Python program for creating a random story generator
